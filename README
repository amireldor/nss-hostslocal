News

   Wed Dec 1 2010:

   [1] Development begun on version 0.1.

Overview

   nss-hostslocal is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
   functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing per-user
   .hosts file, analogous to the global /etc/hosts file.

Current Status

   Development has only just begun.

Documentation

   After compiling and installing nss-hostslocal you'll find a new NSS
   module in /lib:
     * libnss_hostslocal.so.2

   To activate the NSS module you have to edit the /etc/nsswitch.conf
   and add hostslocal to the line starting with "hosts:". On Debian this
   looks like this:
# /etc/nsswitch.conf

passwd:		compat
group:		compat
shadow:		compat

hosts:		files hostslocal dns
networks:	files

protocols:	db files
services:	db files
ethers:		db files
rpc:		db files

netgroup:	nis

   That's it. You should now be able to resolve hosts specified in a
   user's ~/.hosts file with all your applications. For a quick check
   use glibc's getent tool:
$ getent hosts foo.local
192.168.50.4	foo.local

   Replace foo with a host name that has been added to the running
   user's ~/.hosts file.

Requirements

   Currently, nss-hostslocal is tested on Linux only. A fairly modern glibc
   installation with development headers (2.0 or newer) is required.

   nss-hostslocal was developed and tested on Ubuntu GNU/Linux "Maverick"
   from December 2010, but it should work on most other Linux distributions
   (and maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and GNU libtool for
   source code configuration and shared library management.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the source
   tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make install
   (as root) for installation of nss-hostslocal.

   for this one.
